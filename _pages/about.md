I manage the [WE-search Lab](https://www.ashwinia.com/about) (PI: Ashwini Ashokkumar, PhD) at New York University. I graduated from Georgetown University with a BSFS in International Political Economy. At Georgetown, I was a research assistant in the [Laboratoratory on Social and Affective Neuroscience](https://abigailmarsh.com) (PI: Abigail Marsh, PhD) and the [Logg Lab](https://www.jennlogg.com) (PI: Jennifer Logg, PhD).

I am broadly interested in how we coordinate with one another, and the myriad of ways coordination can go wrong. I am particularly interested in how the rules we make facilitate or hinder our coordination.

I like to read [second-hand books](http://passerbymagazine.com/recommendations/secondhand-bookstores-in-new-york-city), listen to [Bach at Noon](https://gracechurchnyc.org/bach-at-noon/), watch [birds](https://www.nycaudubon.org/events-birding/programs-and-events/local-trips-classes), and play tennis.
